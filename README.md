# Tic-Tac-Toe-simulator
A python application to simulate a naive and an experienced player in a game of tic tac toe
#State: Tiles are numbered 1 to 9

"""
Tick-Tac-Toe game state is defined as follows: 

tile1 |  tile2  | tile3
______|_________|______
tile4 |  tile5  | tile6
______|_________|______
tile7 |  tile8  | tile9
______|_________|______

A player can belong to one of the following two categories:
1. Naive: Player checks a tile randomly.
2. Intelligent: Player follows some strategy to win a game. You shall define a strategy that an intelligent player can take.

We will estimate probability of winning for a player for different scenarios. The estimation tests are in the a2test.py file
 
Game1: A number of games are played between two naive players. Estimate probability of winning for player1. Assume player1 starts the game.

Game2: A number of games are played between a naive and intelligent player. Estimate probability of winning for player1. Assume player1 is naive and starts the game.

Game3: A number of games are played between two intelligent players. Estimate probability of winning for player1. Assume player1 starts the game.
